Multi-Modal Stock Signal Classification using a Transformer Architecture
This repository contains the source code for a deep learning project designed to classify short-to-medium term stock market movements. The model leverages a multi-modal data approach, combining fundamental and technical analysis to predict signals as "Long" (Buy), "Short" (Sell), or "Neutral" (Hold).

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop and validate a robust framework for stock trend prediction. By fusing a company's financial health (fundamentals) with market behavior (technicals), the model aims to provide a more holistic and accurate classification than single-modality approaches.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Screener.in (for data scraping).

Features and Data
The model is trained on a feature set derived from two primary data sources:

Fundamental Data: Quarterly financial metrics were scraped from Screener.in. Key features include:

Corporate financials (Sales, Operating Profit, Net Profit)

Valuation Ratios (Earnings Per Share, P/E Ratio)

Performance Metrics (ROCE, Debt-to-Equity)

Technical Data: Standard time-series market data provides the basis for technical analysis.

OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, and other standard indicators.

Engineered Features:

2D Data Transformation: Time-series data is reshaped into a 2D tensor (sequence_length x num_features) to be processed by a vision-transformer-inspired architecture.

Methodology
The project workflow is structured as follows:

Data Acquisition: Custom Python scripts scrape fundamental data from Screener.in, which is then merged with historical technical data.

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: The combined dataset is cleaned, and technical indicators and market regime features are calculated. The final feature set is scaled and normalized.

Data Transformation: The time-series data is converted into sequential 2D tensors, where each tensor represents a "financial image" of a specific time window (e.g., 30 days).

Modeling: A Transformer-based neural network processes these 2D tensors. The architecture is designed to capture both local (day-to-day) and global (long-term) patterns within the sequence.

Training and Labeling: The model is trained using a 20-day forward-looking window to generate labels. A price change exceeding a set threshold determines the "Long" or "Short" class, with the remainder classified as "Neutral".

Of course. Here is a revised, professional version of the README.md.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop and validate a robust framework for stock trend prediction. By fusing a company's financial health (fundamentals) with market behavior (technicals), the model aims to provide a more holistic and accurate classification than single-modality approaches.

The methodology involves advanced feature engineering, including KMeans clustering to identify market regimes, and the application of a Transformer-based deep learning model to capture complex temporal dependencies in the financial data.
